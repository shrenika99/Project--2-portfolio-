# Project--2-portfolio-
This is the second project I worked on it is a PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE. This is my first portfolio website and the skills I used for this project are:HTML which helped me in defining the headers, footers, paragraphs, links, images and more, it helped me in creating the structure of my website and the second skill I used in the project is CSS which helped me in the layout and styling of the website.
